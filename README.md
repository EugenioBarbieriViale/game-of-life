# Game of Life
Conway's game of life written in C using the raylib graphic library

# Dependencies
You need [raylib](https://www.raylib.com/) installed.

# How to
```console
$ chmod +x build.sh
$ ./build.sh
```
You should now see two executables. Run:
```console
$ ./main
```
You can choose the alive cells of the first generation by clicking on them. Press space to start/stop. Press "c" to clear.
The other program is a minimal version that initializes the first generation randomly.
